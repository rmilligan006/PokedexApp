# PokedexApp
 <h1>Description</h1>
 
 This is my first attempt in making a pokedex through javascript. Using modals to pull the data into a seperate modal that shows the image of the pokemon, the height and weight, and the types and styles of the pokemon.
 
 I like it, using modals is a interesting thing to learn, I kind of wish there was another way to show the data. Just shows i need to work with modals a bit more to become experienced with it more.
 
 This program uses a api from "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150" I eventually want to build a search feature in it. As the number of pokemon has grown expotentally I believe it will make the progam more dynamic. Also would love to add a loading splash screen. Maybe something that looks like it's opening up the actual pokeDex. 
 
 All in all this was a fun learning experience.
